XMLHttpRequest (XHR), Fetch API, Axios, and jQuery AJAX are all APIs in JavaScript.
Each of these APIs provides functionality for making HTTP requests, but they are not REST APIs themselves.
While these APIs are used to interact with RESTful APIs by sending HTTP(such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) requests and handling responses, they are not REST APIs themselves.
REST APIs are server-side architectural patterns that define how clients can interact with resources over the network using HTTP methods.
